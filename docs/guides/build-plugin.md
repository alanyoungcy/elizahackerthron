# Plugin Development Guide

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Eliza, ensure you have:

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Git for version control
- A code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) or [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) recommended)
- [Flow-cli](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli) for Flow blockchain interaction.

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

## Quickstart

Please follow the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md) to set up your development environment.

## Plugin Development

### Create a Plugin repository from Template

Visit [Eliza Plugin Template](https://github.com/onflow/eliza-plugin-template) and click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository.

Or you can create a new empty repository and copy the files from some examples at [Eliza Plugins](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins) organization.

> Note: Flow's Eliza plugin template is using Dependency Injection(`@elizaos-plugins/plugin-di`), you can learn more about the Dependency Injection in the [plugin's README.md](https://github.com/fixes-world/plugin-di).  It allows you can use `Class` instead of `Object` for your `Actions`, `Providers`, `Services`, and etc. **If you don't want to use it, you can follow the other examples in Eliza Plugins organiazation.**

### Add the Plugin repository to your Eliza project

Let's say you created a repository named `username/plugin-foo`.

Use submodules to add the plugin repository to your Eliza project.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/username/plugin-foo.git packages/plugin-foo
```

Change the package's name in the plugin's `package.json` to `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo`.

```json
{
    "name": "@elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo",
}
```

Add the plugin to agent's `package.json`

```bash
pnpm add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo@'workspace:*' --filter ./agent
```

Check the `agent/package.json` to ensure the plugin is added, you should see something like this:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "@elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo": "workspace:*"
    }
}
```

### Build the Plugin

Build the plugin using the following command:

```bash
pnpm build --filter ./packages/plugin-foo

# Or build all packages
pnpm build
```

### Add Plugin to the `character.json` you want to use

Let's say you want to add the plugin to the `sample` character which is `characters/sample.character.json`.

```json
{
    "name": "Sample",
    "plugins": [
        "@elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo"
    ]
}
```

> Note: If you are using Dependency Injection(`@elizaos-plugins/plugin-di`) in your plugin, remember to add it to the `postProcessors` field. And **`clients` field is deprecated** in the latest version of Eliza, so if you want to add clients you also need to use `plugins` field.

```json
{
    "name": "Sample",
    "plugins": [
        "@elizaos-plugins/plugin-foo",
        "@elizaos-plugins/client-discord"
    ],
    "postProcessors": [
        "@elizaos-plugins/plugin-di"
    ]
}
```

### Run the Eliza Agent with your Plugin

Run the Eliza agent to test the plugin.

```bash
pnpm start --character="characters/sample.character.json"

# Or with more debug logs
pnpm start:debug --character="characters/sample.character.json"
```

### Interact with the Agent

Now you're ready to start a conversation with your agent.

Open a new terminal window and run the client's http server.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

## Plugin Registration

You need to register your plugin in the [Eliza Plugin Registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) to make it available for other users.

Please follow the guide there, modify the [index.json](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/blob/main/index.json) and submit a PR to the registry repository.
